test project is our working projectory
we can create a  local repository(repo) which is stored in the system and remote repository(repo) which is stored somewhere else and can be shared in GIthub

 git innit command to initialise ypur project folder(1 time process)
 git status used to display the status of the workin git{
    tracked and untracked
 git files are there in   git}

 git add is used to add files to stagging area
 to add a file use git add filename
 or to add all files use . operator 
 git add .
  this process is caalled stage and unstage process
   to unstage  git restore filename
   to display the diffresces we can use git diff command 

we use git commit command to change our code status from staged to local repo
git commit -m "message" is used here where "-m"is used to display the message that indicates the commit whichhelps the programmer to understand what we commit 
git log command tell the user the commit history,id and more 
 to uncommit the things we use git reset --soft HEAD^ 
 if use use hard it will delete  all the code 
 if we use git checkout commit id of  teh file we can go to that file
 git checkout master to find the file where the head is in at the moment
what is HEAD?
git show commit_id to show details abt that particular commit
to see what changes were made between two commits we use git diff commit-id..commit-id
git shoe HEAD is used to show details of the commit whichever your head refering to
HEAD changes to commit to commit on each commit we do 
if we want to undo our commit which we can go back to last version before the current version or commit we use git reset -soft HEAD^/gti reset HEAD^/git reset --hard HEAD^
to change all our works from local repository to remote repository so we can share our code and work with others
we use git push,git pull commands to do these things
git clone url to download the remote repository into local machine
SSH?
ssh stands for secure shell head it helps us to create a secure communication while we push or pull files it increases the security .
 we can use ssh key to clone and import repositories into our local repo

 git pull is used to pull code from remote repo to our local repo


 gitignore :- things we keep as a secret (.gitignore) 
 these files are not pushed into your remote repo .it is only seen in local repo
 git branch 
 ->git branch is used to create an altenative file rather than master file
 ->git branch command is used to show all the branches used 

 git branch branchname is how to create a branch 
 we can later merge this branch to master branch 
 using git merge branchname
 git switch branchname is used to move to another branch
 git checkout branchname is used to switch to a specific branch
